* I deployed a [webpage](https://realdreammaker.github.io/Demographic-Analysis/) to show a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.

* The a scatter plot represents each state with circle elements      
    
* State abbreviations were included in the circles.

* The plot has responsive gridlines.  

* Create and situate axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

* I placed additional labels in the scatter plot and gave them click events so that the users can decide which data to display. 

* Animation was applied to the transitions for the circles' locations as well as the range of the axes

* I added tooltips to the circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected. I used the `d3-tip.js` plugin developed by [Justin Palmer](https://github.com/Caged).
